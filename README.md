# Rice-Mill-Automation-System
The system processes and packs grains like rice, popcorn, and beans. Grains move from storage, through steaming, drying, and into packing via conveyor belts (C1-C5), driven by motors (M1-M6). After filling 100 packets, the C6 container transfers them to storage. Automation is planned for full control.
